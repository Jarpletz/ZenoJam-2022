Hell-Icopter is a small game developed by August Rothpletz and Jackson Henry. It was fully created within a week as a submission for the [ZenoJam 6](https://itch.io/jam/zeno-jam-6) game jam. Our game placed 6th out of 146 submissions!

This is Unity project for our game, but if you would like, you can [play it for free on itch.io](https://jarpletz.itch.io/hell-icopter)!

_Oh no! Your helicopter just fell down a sinkhole into Hell! (Relatable, right?!) In your desperate attempt to escape, avoid the perils of hell such as demons, falling rocks, lavafalls, and more as you rise above the relentless rise of the lava river._

_Hell-Icopter is a 2D arcade-style endless game made for ZenoJam 6. Try and get the highest score possible as you traverse your desperate journey through Hell. Most importantly, Good Luck: You're going to need it!_
